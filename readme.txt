Solitaire:
A port of the game I made for my iPod clone. Plays as similar as I can get to the Windows version of Solitaire.

Controls:
Left Shoulder		- Deal 3 cards
Right Shoulder		- If cards have been grabbed:		Place them in the most appropriate pile
			  If no cards have been grabbed:	Grab as many cards as you are allowed to
Right + Left Shoulder	- New Game

X			- Grab card(s)/Place grabbed card(s)
O			- If cards have been grabbed:		Put them back in the pile you got them from
			  If no cards have been grabbed:	Grab one from the dealt card pile

Left or Right (Dpad)	- Select previous/next card pile
Up or Down (Dpad)	- Select higher/lower card/card pile

Start 			- Main menu

Future Additions:
 - Persistant settings (INI file?)

Additional thanks:
I'd like to thank Exophase, Yeldarb2k3, PDGB and Psilocybeing for helping me get into PSP programming
